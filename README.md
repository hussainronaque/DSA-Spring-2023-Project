# Sudoku Solver Project

This project implements a Sudoku solver and game using the Tkinter library in Python. The solver can find a solution to any valid Sudoku puzzle, and the game allows users to play Sudoku with a partially-filled grid.

## Files
- **sudoku_solver.py**: The main Python script containing the Sudoku solver and game implementation.

## How to Run the Solver
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `sudoku_solver.py`.
4. Run the command: `python sudoku_solver.py`.

## How to Play the Game
1. Run the solver as instructed above.
2. Click on the "Play Game" button.
3. A partially-filled Sudoku grid will be generated.
4. Fill in the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9.
5. Click on the "Check" button to validate your input.
6. Click on the "Solve" button to see the solution.

## Solver Algorithm
The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to find the solution to a given Sudoku puzzle. It iteratively fills in the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that the numbers comply with Sudoku rules. If a number is found to be invalid during the process, the solver backtracks and tries a different number.

## Game Generation
The game generates a Sudoku puzzle by first creating a completely filled grid. It then removes a certain number of cells to make it a partially-filled puzzle for the user to solve.

## Tkinter GUI
The project utilizes Tkinter, the standard GUI toolkit for Python, to create a user-friendly interface for both the solver and the game.

## Additional Features
- The solver includes input validation to check if the provided Sudoku puzzle is valid.
- The game includes a "Check" button to validate the user's input.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the features or adapt it to your preferences. Enjoy solving Sudoku puzzles or playing the game!
